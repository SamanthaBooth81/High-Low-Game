# About
High / Low is a game of chance involving, as the title suggests, picking between a higher or lower number than the one randomly generated. This game is targeted for those who enjoy a simple game which is based on decision making using probability as a foundation. 

The use of JavaScript enables the difficulty of the game to increase with each level and the range of numbers grows, starting from 0 - 25 up to 0 - 500.

# User Experience
## User Stories

## Design

### Colour Scheme
I have chosen to use pops of bright colours to tie in with the theme of a light and simple game. The colour is used to grab the users attention to the area of play. 

 The colors used are #38B6FF (a light blue) for the buttons, #FC52FF (a neon pink) for the button borders and #7BFF2B (a neon green) for the button highlight when the mouse hovers over. 
 These were chosen using a square complimentary approach of the color theory generated by [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) .

### Typography

The main font used was 'Acme', Sans-serif. I chose this font as I thought it's playfulness suited the game I was creating but was still easily readable.

I also used the fallback fonts of:
- 'Oswald' sans-serif,
