## About
High / Low is a game of chance involving, as the title suggests, picking between a higher or lower number than the one randomly generated. This game is targeted for those who enjoy a simple game which is based on decision making using probability as a foundation. 

The use of JavaScript enables the difficulty of the game to increase with each level and the range of numbers grows, starting from 0 - 25 up to 0 - 500.
