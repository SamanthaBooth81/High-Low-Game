# User Experience
## User Stories

## Design

### Colour Scheme
I have chosen to use pops of bright colours on a dark background to tie in with the theme of a simple arcade style game. The colour is used to grab the users attention to the area of play. 

 The colors used are #38B6FF (a light blue) for the buttons, #FC52FF (a neon pink) for the button borders and #7BFF2B (a neon green) for the button highlight when the mouse hovers over. 
 These were chosen using a square complimentary approach of the color theory generated by [Adobe Color Wheel](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel) .

### Typography

The main font used was 'Acme', Sans-serif. I chose this font as I thought it's playfulness suited the game I was creating but was still easily readable.

I also used the fallback fonts of:
- 'Oswald' sans-serif,

 - 'Urbanist' sans-serif

### Other Details
- I intentionally designed the button images to flow like an arrow head, up for higher and down for lower. I also, added some pink contrast to the text to tie in with the colour scheme.

- The same theme was applied to the design of the logo, with the shape pointing in both up and down directions.
